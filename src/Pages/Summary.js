<p className=''>What Websites Can WordPress Make?
Hobby or Lifestyle Blogs
Due to WordPress's origin in the blog space, its features for this purpose are rich, including:

The ability to differentiate between posts and pages
A robust WYSIWYG editor for easy post creation
Posts, tags, and categories for creating a rich content organization system
Options for users to leave comments and you to easily moderate them
Once you have WordPress installed, the main thing you'll want to do is choose a theme that appeals to you and what you want to accomplish with your blog. There are themes that accommodate news, magazine, and tiled layouts (and more).

Next, you'll want to add plugins for any functionality you want that doesn't come with the theme, such as social sharing buttons or click-to-tweet.

Professional Portfolios
You can also find a variety of themes for professional portfolios, making WordPress a great choice for showcasing your personal brand. The "Pages" functionality can be used for your homepage, About page, contact page, etc. while the "Posts" functionality can be used for the specific pieces you want to highlight â€” whether they're in image, text, audio, or video format.

You can choose a theme with a built-in gallery, or you can install plugins for portfolio carousels or sliders.

Business Websites
A business website needs to get even more mileage out of WordPress, in many cases having more pages and posts than the average personal blog or site and needing additional functionality. However, due to its powerful built-in CMS capabilities and the open-source community continuing to iterate solutions, WordPress is fantastic at meeting those needs.

You can choose a website theme that works best for what you're looking to accomplish and then customize it acc
ording to your brand. Page builders such as Elementor and Divi make the layout process even easier.</p>
